The "main.py" script is supposed to be placed in the same directory that the plugins folder is supposed to be in.

The plugins folder can be found inside the ".obsidian" folder in your vault.

Also check if the same ".obsidian folder" has a "community-plugins.json" file inside it.

Once you place the main.py script inside the ".obsidian" folder, just run it and it will store all the plugins (active and inactive) inside a file called "plugins.json".

Now you have access to a list of all your obsidian plugins so that you can back it up without having to store the entire plugins folder.
